<p>I've been using Amazon EC2, S3, and SQS services in various projects
at work. For one project, I needed to build a little tool that
integrated SQS and S3 services, and I decided to build it in
Clojure. In the course of building the tool, I learned a bit about the
various open source Java libraries for working with Amazon AWS, and
the issues with integrating them with Clojure.
</p>
<p>
The libraries I used are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jets3t.dev.java.net/">jets3t</a> &ndash; S3 interface
</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/typica/">typica</a> &ndash; SQS and EC2 interface
</li>
<li>Apache <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/">commons-httpclient</a> and associated dependencies
</li>
<li><a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/">postgres jdbc driver</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Having been away from Java development for some time now, I'd
forgotten about the convoluted mess of Classpaths and Class loaders. I
had a "crash" refresher course in the last week. And, it's all still a
bloody mess. I did come across one-jar, which made it pretty easy to
package up the various jar dependencies into a single deliverable jar
file.
</p>
<p>
In the end, the tool worked out well and served its purpose. Plus, it
was rewarding to be able to write code like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defun process-loop [:key
                     aws-access-key
                     aws-secret-key
                     geo-db-path
                     [message-count 5]
                     [sleep 5000]
                     sqs-queue]
  (with-geo-service (geo-get-service :path geo-db-path)
    (with-sqs-queue (sqs-get-queue aws-access-key aws-secret-key sqs-queue)
      (with-connection *db*
        (let [process (fn [msgs]
                        (if (empty? msgs)
                          (Thread/sleep sleep)
                          (try
                            (transaction
                             (doseq [msg msgs] (process-message msg)))
                            (doseq [msg msgs] (sqs-delete-message msg))
                            (catch java.sql.BatchUpdateException ex
                              (println "* process error:"
                                       (.getNextException ex))))))]
          (while true
            (try
              (process (sqs-receive-messages message-count))
              (catch Exception ex
                (println "* error:" ex)))))))))

<p>
I've committed some of the code for the Amazon integration into the
cynojure git repository, in case anyone else finds it useful.

Harmony.

<p>I finally got around to creating a repository for some of the Clojure
code I'm developing on github. It's quite spare right now; just the
Common Lisp like <code>defun</code> macro, a few odd helper functions, and the
SQL query syntax I'd written about before.
</p>
<p> 
The repository is online at <a href="http://github.com/kriyative/cynojure/tree/master">http://github.com/kriyative/cynojure/tree/master</a>.

<p> 
I'm not all that happy with the SQL macros, but haven't had a whole
lot of time to play with it. I've been too distracted with real work.
</p></div><footer class="post-footer" /></article><article class="post format-standard"><header class="post-header"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2009/05/08/sql-s-expressions/">sql and s-expressions</a></h1><p class="post-meta">Posted on 08 May 2009</p></header><div class="post-content">
<p>On one of the Common Lisp projects I worked on (a very typical Web
app), I used the CLSQL library to integrate with a Postgres
database. CLSQL is itself an opensource version of the SQL package
which is part of Lispworks. One of the more interesting features of
this library was an s-expression based query language, which emitted
SQL query strings behind the scenes. So, for example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(select [count 1]
        :from '([person])
        :where [and [= [role] +role-programmer+]
                [&lt; [age] 30]))
</pre>


<p>
would emit the following SQL (and actually runs the query):
</p>
<pre class="example">
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM person WHERE (role = 1 AND age &lt; 30)
</pre>


<p>
Nice. Just being able to write the WHERE clause as a readable
s-expression makes CLSQL worthwhile. Of course, it does much more than
just that.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Clojure has a library in clojure-contrib, for integrating with
SQL databases using JDBC. But, as you can see from the examples on
that wiki page, SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE more or less require hand
built SQL query strings. So, I figured I'd try and emulate the CLSQL
approach using Clojure macrology. Here's what I was able to do:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(sql-select-stmt "count(1)"
                 :from '(person)
                 :where (sql-and (sql-= 'role +role-programmer+)
                                 (sql-&lt; 'age 30)))
</pre>


<p>
Not as concise as CLSQL (the "sql-" prefix interrupts the flow), but
perhaps the best we can do, considering Clojure doesn't have
programmable reader macros (at least not without serious
hackery). CLSQL cleverly uses reader macros to do interesting things
with expressions which are inside square brackets, like turning <code>[or ...]</code> into <code>(sql-or ...)</code>, and <code>[a-table-name]</code> into "a<sub>table</sub><sub>name</sub>"
etc.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, <code>sql-select-stmt</code> doesn't run the query, just generates
the query string, which can be passed to <code>with-results</code>, like so:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(with-results rs
  (sql-select-stmt "count(1)"
                   :from from
                   :where where)
  (:count (first rs)))
</pre>


<p>
The code for the sql macros is a bit long to insert here, so I'm
thinking I'll create a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cynojure</span> repo on github, and put all the
various bits of clojure code I create in there. I'll post about that
separately.
</p>
<p>
Peace.

<p>Welcome to cynojure &ndash; a blog about <a href="http://clojure.org/">clojure</a> &ndash; a modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>
implementation.
</p>
<p>
I've been hacking Lisp, professionally and as a hobbyist, for about
eighteen years now. Starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">elisp</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>, and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common Lisp</a> for the past eight years. At the risk of importing my CV into
this post, I've worked in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, Objective-C, Java; even some
Cadence SKILL. More recently, I got to work on a reasonably extensive
project in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a>. Before you write me off as a mono-lingual snob, let
me assure you I've had a fair amount of experience with C and its
derivative family of languages as well. I just happen to be a bigger
fan of Lisp, and functional programming in general; which leads me to
clojure.
</p>
<p>
I first heard about clojure a year back, and was very impressed with
the design motivations of its creator, Rich Hickey. A pure functional
Lisp with immutable data structures, STM, actors &hellip; and, efficient
Java interop! Sounded too good, so I had to check it out. Since then,
I've been following the development of the language and its libraries,
read the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a> book, and played with it enough to be
somewhat productive.
</p>
<p>
And, this week (May 4, 2009) Rich Hickey formally <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/bcbdad671327d2f5">announced</a> the
release of Clojure 1.0, which is great news. Congratulations to Rich
and all the other contributors. To mark this major milestone in
Clojure's history, and to add my own little bit to its growth, I
decided to blog about my experiences with clojure as I learn and apply
it. Hopefully, my experiences will be of some use or entertainment to
others :)
</p>
<p>
Happy hacking.
</p>
<p>
PS: About the name - cynojure is a play (in keeping with clojure
tradition) on the word cynosure, which according to <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=cynosure">WordNet</a> has the
following meanings:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>cynosure
</p>
<p>
something that provides guidance (as Polaris guides mariners)
</p>
<p>
something that strongly attracts attention and admiration
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Perhaps a bit grandiose, but I thought it was suitable.
</p></div><footer class="post-footer" /></article><article class="post format-standard"><header class="post-header"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2009/05/06/keyword-args-in-clojure/">keyword args in clojure</a></h1><p class="post-meta">Posted on 06 May 2009</p></header><div class="post-content">
<p>I like the keyword args support in Common Lisp. So, when I learned
that clojure didn't support keyword args in the base language, I was a
bit disappointed. But, with clojure's support for destructuring and
macros, it should be easy to build keyword args &hellip; right?
</p>
<p>
Rich Hickey posted a simple example on the clojure mailing list, which
I adapted slightly to my taste:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defmacro defun [sym args &amp; body]
  (let [[pargs [_ &amp; kargs]] (split-with (fn [x] (not (= x '&amp;key))) args)
        gkeys (gensym "gkeys__")
        letk (fn [k]
               (let [[nm val] (if (vector? k) k [k])
                     kname (keyword (name nm))]
                 `(~nm (or (~gkeys ~kname) ~val))))]
    `(defn ~sym [~@pargs &amp; k#]
       (let [~gkeys (apply hash-map k#)
             ~@(apply concat (map letk kargs))]
         ~@body))))
</pre>


<p>
After which:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defun foo [a b &amp;key c [d 5]]
  [a b c d])

user&gt; (foo 1 2 :c 10)
[1 2 10 5]
</pre>


<p>
Joy.
