<p>This is my shiny new site hosted on github.com. I used to previously
blog at <a href="http://funcall.posterous.com">funcall.posterous.com</a> and <a href="http://cynojure.posterous.com">cynojure.posterous.com</a>, but I think
<a href="http://github.com">github</a> may be a more natural fit for my edit and publish workflow.
After all, most of my professional and hobbyist programming work lives
here, so why not my blog.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I'm using <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> to author the posts and a
modified version of the <a href="http://nakkaya.com/static.html">static</a> blog generation tool to generate the

<p>This is the second in a two part post about a Clojure programmer
workflow entirely within Emacs.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Editing Clojure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Some useful navigation key bindings in Clojure-mode, actually any Lisp
code editing mode in Emacs, are as follows:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption></caption>
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col" class="left">Keybinding</th><th scope="col" class="left">Command</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-f</code></td><td class="left"><code>forward-sexp</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-b</code></td><td class="left"><code>backward-sexp</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-a</code></td><td class="left"><code>beginning-of-defun</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-e</code></td><td class="left"><code>end-of-defun</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-x</code></td><td class="left"><code>slime-compile-defun</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-x C-e</code></td><td class="left"><code>slime-eval-last-expression</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Some of these key bindings get redefined when a buffer is in
<code>slime-mode</code> to SLIME enhanced equivalents, but mostly they behave the
same.
</p>
<p>
And, don't forget the exponential effect of the <code>C-u</code> prefix key.
</p>
<p>
Some other key bindings that are also useful are:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption></caption>
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col" class="left">Keybinding</th><th scope="col" class="left">Command</th><th scope="col" class="left">Doc</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-q</code></td><td class="left"><code>indent-sexp</code></td><td class="left">A lot of times when copying and pasting or otherwise modifying large blocks of s-expressions, the indentation of the code can get out of whack. <code>indent-sexp</code> can help restore the balance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-h</code></td><td class="left"><code>mark-defun</code></td><td class="left"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-M-k</code></td><td class="left"><code>kill-sexp</code></td><td class="left"></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Also worth knowing, the magic of <i>dynamic abbrevs</i> bound to the
<code>M-/</code> key binding. Dynamic abbrevs are a quick way to
complete a long function or var name from a minimal prefix. It's very
brute force (i.e, just searches for a match in all the open buffers),
but since it's very fast, it comes in handy when you're working with
partially evaluated Clojure code.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Clojure REPL</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Everything begins with a Clojure instance which has SWANK loaded.
Again, there are lots of ways of starting one of these, and the most
common use case is with a <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/">Leiningen</a> project setup. Setting up
Leiningen is beyond the scope of this post, but the docs on
Leiningen's github page are quite helpful in getting you started.
</p>
<p>
Once Leiningen is setup and you have a <code>project.clj</code> file for your
project, you can invoke <code>clojure-jack-in</code>.
</p>
<p>
Once SLIME is connected, it's helpful to know the following commands:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

</description></item><item><title>Emacs for Clojure - Part 1</title><link>http://kriyative.github.com/2012/07/21/emacs-for-clojure-1/</link><description>
<p>This is a brief overview of the way I work in Clojure using Emacs -
almost exclusively. Obviously, Emacs is not the only way to interact
with Clojure, but it can be a pretty seamless and efficient
environment for Clojure, once you become familiar with the powerful
extensibility and "mouse-free" efficiency of Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Also, since Emacs uses Lisp as its extension language, there's a lot
of value for a Clojure/Lisp developer in learning and mastering the
Emacs' ecosystem. I hope this series of posts will be helpful in that
endeavour.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of "getting started with Emacs" docs available online
and on the web. The easiest one is the built-in <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/plain/etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL?h=emacs-24">Tutorial</a>, which you
can also bring up within Emacs with <code>C-h t</code> or <code>M-x help-with-tutorial</code>.  Other online references:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/">A Guided Tour of Emacs</a>

</li>
<li><a href="http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html">A Tutorial Introduction to GNU Emacs</a>
</li>
</ol>



<p>
For the most part, I'm going to assume you're using Emacs default key
bindings, but the following customizations don't really depend on
that.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Process</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
My typical work-flow involves the following steps (but not necessarily
in the same order always):
</p>
<pre class="example">
(loop []
  ;; Edit code/tests
  ;; Interactive development with REPL and tests
  ;; Look up documentation
  ;; Search and Navigate a code tree
  ;; Run batch tests
  ;; Merge commits and resolve conflicts in Git
  (recur))
</pre>


<p>
I'll try to cover each of these steps in detail over the course of the
next few posts.

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Clojure Mode Setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Like snowflakes and Sting albums, there are myriad ways of setting up
the Clojure environment in Emacs, but essentially all of them should
be doing something similar to the following:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defun clojure-mode-hook ()
  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil
        clojure-mode-use-backtracking-indent t)
  (setup-clojure-indentation-rules))
(require 'clojure-mode)
(require 'clojure-test-mode)
(require 'swank-clojure)
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'clojure-mode-hook)
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'clojure-test-mode)
</pre>

before, check out the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">emacs-starter-kit</a>.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Basic Editing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
It's good to get familiar with the basic cursor movement keys such as:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption></caption>
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col" class="left">Keybinding</th><th scope="col" class="left">Command</th></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-n</code></td><td class="left"><code>next-line</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-p</code></td><td class="left"><code>previous-line</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-f</code></td><td class="left"><code>forward-char</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-b</code></td><td class="left"><code>backward-char</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-a</code></td><td class="left"><code>move-beginning-of-line</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><code>C-e</code></td><td class="left"><code>move-end-of-line</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
There's been a lot of cursing and teeth gnashing about Emacs' default
key bindings, but here are some of the benefits that I've come to
appreciate over time:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Clustering &ndash; you can insert and move around with minimal physical
   movement from the <i>home row</i> of the keyboard.

</li>
<li>Easy to remember

</li>
<li>Work in <code>bash</code> and even on tty devices (never say never) - this is
   particularly useful if you're planning to do some remote pairing
   over <code>tmux</code> or <code>screen</code>
</li>
</ol>


<p>
And, there is always <code>C-h b</code> <code>describe-bindings</code> which will list the
key bindings in any given buffer.
</p>
<p>
Other useful basic key bindings:

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Keyboard Macros</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
We've all been in situations where we've had to fix up some literal
data structure or otherwise munge code by repeating a set of editing
keystrokes, either deleting, inserting or otherwise splicing
text. Keyboard macros can quickly help automate some of this work.
</p>
<p>
The basic principle is that you begin recording a macro <code>C-x (</code>
<code>kmacro-start-macro</code>, perform the keyboard actions, and then end
recording with <code>C-x )</code> <code>kmacro-end-macro</code>. You can then replay the
macro using <code>C-x e</code> <code>kmacro-end-and-call-macro</code>. Also, check out
<code>C-x C-k n</code> <code>kmacro-name-last-macro</code> for oft repeated macros.

<p>I'm releasing <a href="http://github.com/kriyative/clojurejs">clojurejs</a> &ndash; a Clojure library for translating a Clojure
subset language to Javascript. The code is on github reachable at the
following link:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://github.com/kriyative/clojurejs">http://github.com/kriyative/clojurejs</a>
</p>
<p>
clojurejs is something I've been working on for a few weeks as part of
a larger web app in Clojure. The code's a bit crufty (reflects my
incremental discovery of the inconsistencies in Javascript), but
functional and I wanted put something out there for people to check
out. I welcome bug reports and feedback. It's been useful for my
specific needs, and I'd be happy if it's even marginally useful to
others.
</p>
<p>
I realize there are a number of other efforts to compile/translate
Clojure (or other Lisp subset) to Javascript, but nothing quite fit my
requirements, which prompted me to build clojurejs. Some useful
aspects of clojurejs are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent scoping in let and loop/recur forms
</li>
<li>Macros with defmacro
</li>
<li>Implicit return from all forms
</li>
<li>loop/recur translates to Javascript for loops
</li>
<li>Translates Clojure vectors, strings, keywords, symbols and maps to
  Javascript equivalents
</li>
<li>dot form access to methods and properties
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Here's an example from the README:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(js
 (defn join [arr delim]
   (loop [str (get arr 0)
          i 1]
     (if (&lt; i (length arr))
       (recur (+ str delim (get arr i))
              (+ i 1))
       str))))
</pre>


<p>
translates to the following Javascript:
</p>

<pre class="example">
join = function(arr, delim) {
    return (function () {
        for (var str = arr[0],i = 1; true;) {
            if ((i &lt; arr.length)) {
                str = (str + delim + arr[i]);
                i = (i + 1);
                continue;
            } else {
                return str;
            } break;
        }
    })();
}
</pre>


<p>
Documentation is regrettably scarce, but there are more details in the
README file, boot.cljs, and the unit tests. I hope to add more
documentation and examples in the next few weeks. Stay tuned.

<p>There's been a bit of recent interest in building "real" apps using
ECL/iOS. While the `eclffi' sample code in the <a href="https://github.com/kriyative/ecl-iphone-builder/tree/centaur">ecl-iphone-builder</a> repo
included examples of how to create/call Objective-C classes/methods
from Lisp, it was missing the glue to go the other way, which was
necessary to implement callbacks in Lisp. I've pushed an update to
github which adds this functionality.
</p>
<p>
As an example I created a subclass of <code>UIButton</code> called <code>UIButtonCB</code>
with one instance var called <code>clickHandler</code>, which can be set to a
Lisp function pointer. The <code>UIButtonCB</code> class wires the
<code>UIControlEventTouchUpInside</code> event to the specified handler function.
</p>
<pre class="example">
@implementation UIButtonCB

- (id) initWithFrame: (CGRect) aFrame
{
    [super initWithFrame: aFrame];
    clickHandler = Cnil;
    [self addTarget: self action: @selector(clicked:) forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    return self;
}

- (void) setClickHandler: (cl_object) fun
{
    register_cb(clickHandler, fun);
}

- (void) clicked: (id) sender
{
    if (Cnil != clickHandler) {
        cl_funcall(2, clickHandler, ecl_foreign_data_ref_elt(&amp;sender,ECL_FFI_POINTER_VOID));
    }
}

- (void) dealloc
{
    remove_cb(clickHandler);
    clickHandler = Cnil;
    [super dealloc];
}
</pre>


<p>
The call to <code>register_cb()</code> ensures that the callback function is
protected from GC, and <code>remove_cb()</code> makes the function GC'able
again. <code>UIButtonCB</code> can now be wrapped in Lisp with the following FFI
glue:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defun set-click-handler (view fun)
  (when fun
    (c-fficall ((view :pointer-void)
                ((make-callback-function fun) :object))
        :void
      "[#0 setClickHandler: #1];")))

(defun make-button (&amp;rest init-view-args &amp;key title title-color icon
                    on-click (enabled t) &amp;allow-other-keys)
  (let ((view (make-view-instance "UIButtonCB" init-view-args)))
    (set-click-handler view on-click)
    (when icon (set-image view icon))
    (when title (set-title view title))
    (when title-color (set-title-color view title-color))
    (set-enabled view enabled)
    view))
</pre>


<p>
Here's an example of the Lisp code to create a button with an on-click
callback, which updates a label:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(let ((n 0)
      (label (make-label "" :frame '(10.0 50.0 300.0 35.0))))
  (add-subview (key-window) label)
  (add-subview (key-window)
               (make-button :frame '(140 230 40 20)
                            :title "click"
                            :background-color (color-argb 1 0.5 0.5 0.5)
                            :on-click (lambda (button)
                                        (declare (ignore button))
                                        (set-text label
                                                  (format nil
                                                          "~d click~:p"
                                                          (incf n)))))))
</pre>


<p>
Obviously, this isn't a very sophisticated approach, but it's a
start. It requires subclassing each UIControl or UIView to add the
vars to store the Lisp callbacks. I'm sure there's ample room for
abstracting or automating some of this boilerplate Objective C code.

<p>Here's a simple hack to get an Org-mode agenda view to popup in an
Emacs buffer, daily at a specified time.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defvar daily-agenda-timer (parse-relative-time "9:00 am"))
;; (decode-time daily-agenda-timer)
 
(defun show-daily-agenda ()
  (unless (time-less-p (current-time) daily-agenda-timer)
    (setq daily-agenda-timer (time-add daily-agenda-timer
                                     (seconds-to-time 86400)))
    (org-agenda-list)))
 
(add-hook 'display-time-hook 'show-daily-agenda)
(display-time)
</pre>


<p>
The <code>parse-relative-time</code> function helps in initializing the
<code>daily-agenda-timer</code> using a human readable string.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defun parse-relative-time (time-str)
  (destructuring-bind (sec min hour day month year dow dst zone)
      (parse-time-string time-str)
    (destructuring-bind (sec1 min1 hour1 day1 month1 year1 dow1 dst1 zone1)
      (decode-time)

<p>I've uploaded a snapshot of fully patched ECL-9.12.3, and Boehm GC
sources to help anyone trying to build this environment from
scratch. I realize a lot of the external dependencies tend to be in
flux, so hopefully this snapshot will provide a fully functional
starting point.
</p>
<p>
The snapshot is available at:
<a href="http://github.com/kriyative/ecl-iphone-snapshot">http://github.com/kriyative/ecl-iphone-snapshot</a>
</p>
<p>
The snapshot includes:
</p>
<pre class="example">
README
build.sh
bdwgc/
ecl/
eclshell/
iphone/
</pre>


<p>
The bdwgc/ and ecl/ directories contain the patched sources for Boehm
GC, and ECL 9.12.3. The eclshell/ folder has the sources for the
sample iPhone app, including a snapshot of slime (CVS head as of
2010-01-29).
</p>
<p>
The iphone/ folder contains the built product &ndash; a set of header and
static library files built for the iPhone architecture. The
iphone/universal/ folder contains `fat' versions of the libraries
which maybe used with either simulator or device builds.
</p>
<p>
As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: I moved to a github repo for the snapshot as well. It's easier
this way to track any patches that may arise.

<p>I haven't been working in Clojure for a couple of months now, hence
the absence of new posts here.
</p>
<p>
However, I have been posting some updates on my other Lisp related
blog (yes, I have two Lisp blogs :) &hellip; about my work in porting the
Embedded Common Lisp system to the iPhone. Sound interesting, check it
out at:
