#+title: ECL on iPhone update
#+tags: common-lisp ecl ios iphone

I've just checked in a significant set of changes to the
[[http://github.com/kriyative/ecl-iphone-builder][ecl-iphone-builder]] repository, incuding the following updates:

- builds with ECL 9.12.3
- requires the CVS head version of the Boehm Weiss collector
- smoother build process (should "just work")
- better SLIME integration (with :spawn communication style as the default)
- expanded `eclshell' example (more goodies to follow)

As always feedback and bug reports are appreciated.
