Rich Hickey [[http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_frm/thread/cc77df25e98ce46b][posted]] a compelling message about funding the future
development of Clojure.

I donated, and urge all Lispers to consider the same. Clojure maybe
one of the best things to happen to Lisp in a long while, and it and
Rich are most deserving of our continued support.

Donate at [[http://clojure.org][clojure.org]].
