#+title:  clojure, emacs, and docs redux
#+tags: clojure emacs java javadoc lisp slime

A while back I'd [[http:/2009/06/21/clojure-emacs-and-javadocs/][written]] about looking up Javadocs from Clojure mode
buffers. I got some good feedback on that post, so I thought I'd try
and expand on that and see if I could integrate other Clojure
documentation sources into a similar workflow.

Looking up Clojure doc strings within Emacs is really easy. In any
Clojure code buffer, you can place your cursor at a symbol and use
=C-c C-d d= or =M-x slime-describe-symbol= to bring up the function or
var doc string.

Previously, I'd made a =slime-javadoc= command that could be
configured to search external Javadoc sources only. However, that
mechanism could be applied more generally to more sources.

The new command =M-x clojuredocs=, can show either Javadocs for Java
classes, or goes to the excellent [[http://clojuredocs.org][clojuredocs.org]] site for
documentation specific to =clojure.core= and a few other namespaces
(such as =ring=), or eventually fallsback to a simple Google search.

So, after connecting to a Clojure instance (via =clojure-jack-in= or
=slime-connect=), I can invoke =M-x clojuredocs= on any symbol and get
back some relevant documentation or at the least som helpful pointers
from Google.

I've committed an initial version of the Emacs Lisp code into the
following github repo:

Feedback and bug reports are most welcome.
