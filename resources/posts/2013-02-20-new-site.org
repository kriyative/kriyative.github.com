#+title:  New Site
#+tags: clojure lisp

This is my shiny new site hosted on github.com. I used to previously
blog at [[http://funcall.posterous.com][funcall.posterous.com]] and [[http://cynojure.posterous.com][cynojure.posterous.com]], but I think
[[http://github.com][github]] may be a more natural fit for my edit and publish workflow.
After all, most of my professional and hobbyist programming work lives
here, so why not my blog.

Incidentally, I'm using [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] to author the posts and a
modified version of the [[http://nakkaya.com/static.html][static]] blog generation tool to generate the
HTML and RSS.
