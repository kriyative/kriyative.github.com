#+title: My talk at Clojure Conj 2015
#+tags: clojure juxt.io

I presented my "Clojure for Business Teams - Decomplecting Data Analysis" talk at Clojure Conj 2015 on Monday. I had some technical issues with my laptop in the beginning, but managed to get past them. The audience was incredibly patient and supportive. I really appreciate that.

The video of the talk has already been published on [[https://youtu.be/WNOTVsthhpI][Youtube]], and I've included a PDF of the slide deck I used below [1].

Thanks to the awesome folks who organize Clojure Conj for inviting me to present. Do check out all the other great talks that they've posted also.
