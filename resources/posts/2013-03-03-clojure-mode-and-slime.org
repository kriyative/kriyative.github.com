#+title:  clojure-mode and slime
#+tags: clojure emacs slime

As a long time user of [[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]] I was a bit disappointed to see
clojure-mode 2.0 drop support for it in favor of =nrepl=. I looked
into =nrepl= but found it to be not as feature complete as SLIME, at
present. Also, I still work on some sizeable Common Lisp code, which
relies entirely on SLIME, and I want to be able leverage any tooling
work I do across all my projects -- so SLIME wins.

As it turns out, it wasn't at all difficult to resurrect the SLIME
integration code from clojure-mode 1.x and load it alongside the newer
clojure-mode.

I've committed the =clojure-mode-slime.el= Emacs Lisp code into the
following repo, along with some other Clojure/Emacs hacks:

I hope this is useful to other SLIME die-hards in the Clojure
community as well.  Feedback and bug reports are most welcome.
