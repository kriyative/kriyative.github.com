#+title: ECL for iOS updated to work with SDK 4.2
#+tags: common-lisp ecl ios ipad iphone

I've pushed a new branch (centaur) of the ECL for iOS project to
github, which contains a number of fixes to get ECL compiled under the
latest 4.2 SDK from Apple. This release has been tested on iPhone and
iPad devices running iOS 4.2 as well as the older 3.1.3. Please refer
to the updated README for further details.
