#+title: cynojure - clojure library on github
#+tags: clojure

I finally got around to creating a repository for some of the Clojure
code I'm developing on github. It's quite spare right now; just the
Common Lisp like =defun= macro, a few odd helper functions, and the
SQL query syntax I'd written about before.
 
The repository is online at http://github.com/kriyative/cynojure/tree/master. 
 
I'm not all that happy with the SQL macros, but haven't had a whole
lot of time to play with it. I've been too distracted with real work.
