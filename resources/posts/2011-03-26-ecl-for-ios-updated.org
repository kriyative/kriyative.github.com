I've committed a new branch of ECL for iOS, which now requires
ECL-11.1.1 (latest stable), and produces functioning device binaries
for armv6 and armv7 architectures using Xcode 4 and SDK 4.3. This
release has been tested on iPhone and iPad devices running iOS 4.3.1.

Please refer to the updated README for further details.

Please note that the earlier release branch `dragon' has also been
updated to work with Xcode 4, and SDK 4.3. However, it continues to be
based on ECL-10.4.1.
